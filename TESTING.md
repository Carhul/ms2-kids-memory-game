### Testing User Stories ###  

1. As a user I want to see a nice and colourful web application.  
    
    When enter the application, the user meets a nice yellow Kids Memory header and buttons in pink and blue on a yellow background. This is stacked on top of a colourful background image of two lego figures holding balloons. The same color palette follows throughout the application.  
2. As a user I want to see nice pictures.  
  
    We have the entering background image, twelve images when playing the Kids Memory game, and the cool icecream break image before the contact section.  
3.  As a user I want to see my score and how many moves I used.  
    
    The score and moves counter works as it should, and keeps track until finish game and reset is pushed.  
4.  As a user I want to have fun playing the game.  
    
    The game is absolutely fun for the Kids!  
5.  As a user I want to have the ability to contact the developer for questions.  
    
    The contact form looks nice, with possibility to contact after input and submit, clear form or push Play again! 

    

### Manual Testing ###  

* Buttons:  
    * Play and play again button is both working and takes the user to the play section.  
    * Contact button is working, takes the user to the contact section.  
    * Reset button is working. Resets the game.  
    * Submit button did not work. It should send an email to the devloper and alert the user on screen, also send an email to the user with confirmation.
