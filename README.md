### Introduction & Project Goals ###

What is Kids Memory-game? Kids memory-game is a fun and colorful memory-game that should get you in a good mood. It should not be to difficult. The project`s goal is to just relax and have fun! 

This is the second of four Milestone Projects that I (the developer) must complete during my Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. I´m really exited for this memory-game. My kids helped me with pictures and colors and it has been a fun family-project! 

The main requirements in this project is to make a responsive and interactive web application using primarily HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Wireframes are made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This is a really nice program to check out different styles and how the final result would look like on different screensizes.

#### Design for desktop device: ####

### Design ### 
The design of this web application has been created based on the colorful personality of my kids, and of course; Lego!  
  
  As the site is ment for kids in the age between 3 and 8, it was importent that the design reflected that. It`s colorful with nice pictures and easy to navigate and understand. 

  It`s one page, but the "Play" and "Contact" buttons allows you to jump to the section you want. 

  The page starts with the name "Kids memory-game", and the play and contact buttons on a nice background photo of two Lego figures.

  "Play" section. Here the user get`s the explanation on how to play, as it says "Push the boxes and see if you can find a match". Further on the user can see their score, and how many moves they used along the way.

  It then shows "Thank you for playing" and a nice little lego ice-break image before the contact form on a Lego sandman background. 
  
  At the end we got the GitHub icon. 

  All round, the game is looking nice and fun to play. Especially according to my kids!

* Fonts  

  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Peralta#standard-styles): Peralta (fallback Roboto, sans-serif).

* Icons  

  [Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2) provided the icon for [Github](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/github?style=brands).

In the wireframes it first was intended to be Linkedin, snapchat and instagram, but an icon-link to developers GitHub page rather than links to "blank" social media was determined as a better idea.

* Colours  

All the colours were handpicked by the kids, (with a little intervention by the developer!) to ensure a happy and fun expression which appeals to kids.
  
  * Background: Blue Jeans, #37B5FF
  * Text: Middle Yellow, #FEE73B  
  * Buttons: Middle Yellow and Plum Web, #FDA6F5   
  * Stroke: Black, #000000

### Changes from wireframes to published application ###  
The menu-button was only supposed to contain play and contact. As I started to work with the application I made it become two buttons for each instead, as the dropdown seemed redundant.  

Stroke on text and border on buttons was removed as it looked more UX-friendly.  

Reset-button was originally on the same line as Score and Moves. I moved it to be underneath as it looked nicer.

Background image on contact form was to much. When I started to work with it I thought it was distracting and decided to not include it to get a more "clean" look. 


### Features ###  

The web application has a responsive layout who has pretty much the same layout on all screensizes. The thought behind that decision is that the application is for kids. The placement of the content should be easy to remember and use regardless of whether the game is played on a phone or a tablet etc.   

Features that have been implemented:  
* Memory-game
* Score and number of moves used
* Reset button
* Button change color when pushed
* Easy to navigate on all screensizes 
* Contact form with submit button. Here you can ask questions to the developer  
* Social media links 

Features that will be implemented in the future:  
* Highscore
* Increased difficulty
* Background music / button on-off

### Testing ###  
The testing process for me has been through the intire building of the web application, as I wanted everything to be perfect before moving on. It was also importent to make sure that the site meets all the user stories criteria.

For HTML Validate I used [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), for CSS, [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and for JS I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

Testing before deployment:

Wright down all testing under the process !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Here I got two errors the first time, but forgot to take a printscreen. The first one was that I got an extra div I needed to delete, and the second was "spacing not allowed", removed the extra space.  

I have tested the live site on different screens: iphone 6, 8, x and x plus - as well as tablet, desktop l and xl. I can see that it has some small alignment issues to be 100% perfekt, but I am happy with how it looks - for now. 

Testing on both Safari and Google Crome, and working fine. I think maybe it loads a little to slow on gallery page.

### Bugs ###  

ALL BUGS IN HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It has been a large number of issues and bugs during the development of this website, the noteworthy below:  

Header and menu button on top of the background balloon image was not as easy as I thought at first. I needed to google a lot, and in the end I had read and watched so much that I decided to give it a try in the inspection tool with all the new input - and it worked!
For this I used [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [Youtube](https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+html+css+text+over+image+responsive&ei=4ebMYJHyAcTJrgSk1oigBw&oq=youtube+html+css+text+over+image+responsive&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6BAgAEBM6CAgAEBYQHhATOggIIRAWEB0QHjoFCCEQoAE6BwghEAoQoAE6BAghEBVQlDNYnsQBYIHHAWgMcAJ4AIABkgGIAYYYkgEEMjcuN5gBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjR5rzv6KHxAhXEpIsKHSQrAnQQ4dUDCA0&uact=5) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14715796/css-menu-background-height-and-text-height).

addEventListener in JS file would not work. Corrected typo in relative path after hours with panic not finding the bug.

The Memory Game section would not stay in place as a "whole box". After lots of google and coffe break without makeing it right I moved on. When I jumped back to take a new look I discovered that I had not added height and width..

The Memory Game would not work correctly. The boxes turn, but they do not turn back, and sometimes one of the cards fly up on the top-left corner for some reason.
How I solved it: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The GitHub icon would not be styled. I eventually understood that to style it I needed to target the fa-github-square directly.


### Deployment ###  
  Deploying on GitHub pages  
  
  To deploy on GitHub pages from it`s GitHub respository, the following steps were taken:  
    
  1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").  
  2. Locate the [GitHub Respository](https://github.com/Carhul/ms2-kids-memory-game "Link to GitHub repository").  
  3. At the top of the repository, select Settings from the menu items.  
  4. Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" section and push the blue "Check it out here!" text.  
  5. Under "Source" click the drop-down menu labelled "None" and select "Master".  
  6. Select "save", and the page will automatically refresh meaning that the website is now deployed.  
  7. Copy the deployed link to your live website!  

  ### Forking the Repository ###  

  By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:  
    
  1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").  
  2. Locate the [GitHub Respository](https://github.com/Carhul/ms2-kids-memory-game "Link to GitHub repository").  
  3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork".  
  4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  

  ### Creating a Clone ###
