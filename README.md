### Introduction & Project Goals ###

What is Kids Memory-game? Kids memory-game is a fun and colorful memory-game that should get you in a good mood. It should not be to difficult. The project`s goal is to just relax and have fun! 

This is the second of four Milestone Projects that I (the developer) must complete during my Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. IÂ´m really exited for this memory-game. My kids helped me with pictures and colors and it has been a fun family-project! 

The main requirements in this project is to make a responsive and interactive web application using primarily HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript.

## UX ##

### Design ### 
The design of this web application has been created based on the colorful personality of my kids, and of course; Lego!  
  
  As the site is ment for kids in the age between 3 and 8, it was importent that the design reflected that. It`s colorful with nice pictures and easy to navigate and understand. 

  It`s one page, but the menu allows you to jump to the section you want. 

  The page starts with the name; Kids memory-game, and the menu button on a nice background photo of two Lego figures.

  Then right to the "Play" section. Here the user get`s the explanation on how to play, as it says "push the boxes". Further on the user can see their score, and how many moves they used along the way.

  It then shows "Thank you for playing" and a nice little ice-break before the contact form on a Lego background. At the end we got social media icons in purple. 

  All round, the game is looking nice and fun to play. Especially according to my kids!

### Features ###  

Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:  

The Header contains the name of The Wingmans at the left, and the navbar at the right on large screen sizes. When down to medium or less, the navbar collapses but the name remains at the left. The Footer fills one line on large screens, but stack on top of each other on medium or less screen size. 

Features that have been implemented:  
* Easy to navigate on all screensizes.  
* Social media links for more inspiration and more knowledge of who the founders is.
* Link to [Taplist](https://taplist.io/) On Taplist you can watch real-time what beer the Wingmans have on their tap, and how much! Up for a taste? 
* Contact form with submit button. Here you can get the steps for success, ask questions, or just say hello.  
* About Us page where you get to know the vision of the founders.  
* Reviews Section where you can get an impression of how it is to collaborate and speak with the founders.

Features that will be implemented in the future:  
* Video blog / link to youtube  
* Logbook  
* Forum  
* Background music / button on-off  
* Taplist to be implemented on the site, and not open in a new tab

### Testing ###  
The testing process for me has been through the intire building of this project, as I wanted everything to be perfect before moving on. I have also worked closely with the founders with each step, to make sure that the site meets all the user stories criteria.

For HTML Validate I used [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
For CSS I used [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

Testing before deployment:

Index / Home validate - ok   
![Index validate](assets/images/testing/index_validate_ok.png)  

About US validate - error 4 times, before I understod that it was a space in the name of an image.    
![About validate](assets/images/testing/about_validate_error.png)  

About US validate - ok, renamed the image  
![About validate 5](assets/images/testing/about_validate_ok.png)  

Gallery validate - ok  
![Gallery validate](assets/images/testing/gallery_validate_ok.png)  

Contact validate - ok  
![Contact validate](assets/images/testing/contact_validate_ok.png)  

CSS validate - ok  
![CSS validate](assets/images/testing/css_validate_ok.png)

Here I got two errors the first time, but forgot to take a printscreen. The first one was that I got an extra div I needed to delete, and the second was "spacing not allowed", removed the extra space.  

I have tested the live site on different screens: iphone 6, 8, x and x plus - as well as tablet, desktop l and xl. I can see that it has some small alignment issues to be 100% perfekt, but I am happy with how it looks - for now. 

Testing on both Safari and Google Crome, and working fine. I think maybe it loads a little to slow on gallery page.  

Peer-code review - The text color is to light. I agree on that, but I had an issue/bug on that and couldent make it darker, description under "Bugs". I was also told that Taplist should not open in a new tab (bad UX), but be implemented to the site. I will implement taplist to be on the site in the future.

User testing feedback - "Think it would be nice if the name, The Wingmans, on the top left was centered". Only one of the people who was asked to review the site thought that, so I havent made any changes to that, as I personally thinks its nicer on the left.

### Bugs ###  

It has been a large number of issues and bugs during the development of this website, the noteworthy below:  

Footer - wouldent stay at the bottom, it was a tiny gap I needed my mentor to help me with. I was missing the class="h-100" in the html, and that combined with the class="footer mt-auto" it was pushed the final bit.  

Contact form - this I needed to remake 3 times. Learned a lot in the proccess but would have made it a fourth time if I had the time before submit. It was not acting as I wanted it to, and make it perfectly align was hard, but I think it turned out ok in the end. I used bootstrap form, jumbotrone, but landed on container. 

Toggler-icon - when trying to make the navbar darker, I removed the navbar-light. Then the toggler-icon disappeared, and the navbar-dark dit not work either as it made the text white. After several attempts and totaly messing up the css code I ended up adding it back on. I want to make it darker for better UX in the future.

Bootstrap script links - After peer code review I was told that the Bootstrap script links need to be at the bottom of the page. But when I do so, Bootstrap overrides the custom css, and the links turn blue. In the future I will figure out how to solve that and make it right. 

### Deployment ###  
  Deploying on GitHub pages  
  
  To deploy on GitHub pages from it`s GitHub respository, the following steps were taken:  
    
  1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").  
  2. Locate the [GitHub Respository](https://github.com/Carhul/Wingmans-Brygge "Link to GitHub repository").  
  3. At the top of the repository, select Settings from the menu items.  
  4. Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" section and push the blue "Check it out here!" text.  
  5. Under "Source" click the drop-down menu labelled "None" and select "Master".  
  6. Select "save", and the page will automatically refresh meaning that the website is now deployed.  
  7. Copy the deployed link to your live website!  

  ### Forking the Repository ###  

  By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:  
    
  1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").  
  2. Locate the [GitHub Respository](https://github.com/Carhul/Wingmans-Brygge "Link to GitHub repository").
