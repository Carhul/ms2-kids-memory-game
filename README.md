### Introduction & Project Goals ###

What is Kids Memory-game? Kids memory-game is a fun and colorful memory-game that should get you in a good mood. It should not be to difficult. The project`s goal is to just relax and have fun! 

This is the second of four Milestone Projects that I (the developer) must complete during my Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. IÂ´m really exited for this memory-game. My kids helped me with pictures and colors and it has been a fun family-project! 

The main requirements in this project is to make a responsive and interactive web application using primarily HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

### Skeleton ###  
  
Wireframes are made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This is a really nice program to check out different styles and how the final result would look like on different screensizes. This is used instead of Balsamiq on recomendation from my mentor.

### Design ### 
The design of this web application has been created based on the colorful personality of my kids, and of course; Lego!  
  
  As the site is ment for kids in the age between 3 and 8, it was importent that the design reflected that. It`s colorful with nice pictures and easy to navigate and understand. 

  It`s one page, but the "Play" and "Contact" buttons allows you to jump to the section you want. 

  The page starts with the name "Kids memory-game", and the play and contact buttons on a nice background photo of two Lego figures.

  "Play" section. Here the user get`s the explanation on how to play, as it says "Push the boxes and see if you can find a match". Further on the user can see their score, and how many moves they used along the way.
  When all pairs are found, an alert of "Congratulations! You found all the pairs!" will show up.  The user can then push the reset button to play again, or scroll further down. 

  It then shows "It's a great day for gaming!" and a nice little lego ice-break image before the contact form.  

  The contact form have input fields for "Name", "Emailaddress" and "Message". All three needs to be filled before submit. The placeholder text written "by batman" is fun for the kids, and tries to convey that there are no questions or feedback that is stupid.  

  Then you got the submit, clear form and play again buttons before the GitHub icon in the footer who takes the user to the developers GitHub page.

  All round, the game is looking welcoming, delicate and fun to play. Especially according to my kids!

* Fonts  
  
  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Peralta#standard-styles): Peralta (fallback Roboto, sans-serif).  
  This font is picked out by my youngest, she said it had a "fun and playful look", I agree.

* Icons  

  [Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2) provided the icon for [Github](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/github?style=brands).


* Colours  

All the colours were handpicked by the kids, (with a little intervention by the developer!) to ensure a happy and fun expression which appeals to kids.
  
  * Background: Blue Jeans, #37B5FF
  * Text: Middle Yellow, #FEE73B  
  * Buttons: Middle Yellow and Plum Web, #FDA6F5

### Changes from wireframes to published application ###  
The menu-button was only supposed to contain play and contact. As I started to work with the application I made it become two buttons for each instead, as the dropdown seemed redundant. I also chose to place them underneath the Kids Memory text, because two buttons was to much on smaller screen and I wanted it to look as alike as possible on all screensizes as this is an application for kids. 

Stroke: Black #000, on text, and border on buttons, was removed as it looked more UX-friendly.  

Reset-button was originally on the same line as Score and Moves. I moved it to be underneath as it looked nicer.  After middle call with mentor she recommended me to make the content more compact. Therefore, the score, moves and reset are stacked on top of each other.  

Background image on contact form was to much. When I started to work with it I thought it was distracting and decided to not include it to get a more "clean" look.   

On contact form, I decided to add a clear form button, so that the user can clear the form if they want to start over before submitting. I also added a play again button so the user could jump right back in to the game.  

In the wireframes it first was intended to be Linkedin, snapchat and instagram, but an icon-link to developers GitHub page rather than links to "blank" social media was determined as a better idea.  

Text after the Memory Game board said "Thank you for playing!" But after the final call with mentor, I was advised to make it disappear and only show after played. But as I already have a text that shows when played, I changed the text to be "It`s a great day for gaming!".


### Features ###  

The web application has a responsive layout who has pretty much the same layout on all screensizes. The thought behind that decision is that the application is for kids. The placement of the content should be easy to remember and use, regardless of whether the game is played on a phone or a tablet etc.   

Features that have been implemented:  
* Memory-game  
  Let`s the user play a memory game with twelve cards, and by flipping them try to find all matching pairs.  

* Play and contact button  
  Takes the user to the respective section they want.  

* Score and moves  
  Show the user in real-time how many pairs (score), and how many moves used.  

* Reset button  
  Let`s the user reset the game to play again.  

* Operational contact form  
  Input for name, e-mail and message.  

* Submit button  
  Let`s the user submit the contact form after filling out all three input fields. The submit button also clear the form automatic after it is pushed.     

* Clear form button  
  Let`s the user clear the form if he or she writes something wrong and want to start over.  

* Play again button  
  Let`s the user go straight up to the play section to play again without scrolling.  

* Easy to navigate on all screensizes  
  By making the layout look the same by adding responsivnes, it is easy for the user to navigate on all screensizes.  

* GitHub link  
  GitHub link takes the user to the developers GitHub page.  

* Custom 404 page  
* Favicon  

Features that will be implemented in the future:  
* Highscore
* Increased difficulty
* Background music / button on-off
* Sound when boxes in Memory Game are pushed  
* Styled alert messages with lego background
